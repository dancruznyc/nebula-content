// Declare a variable and assign it to a numeric value
let num1 = 99;
// Double that value and re-assign it to the previous variable
num1 *= 2;
// Check it worked by logging to the console
console.log(num1);
// Create two numbers, assign them to variables and add them together
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
// Check it worked by logging to the console
console.log(z);
// Create three numbers, assign them to variables and subtract the smaller two from the largest
let a = 3;
let b = 9;
let c = 21;
let d = c - (a + b);
// Check it worked by logging to the console

// Create two even numbers, assign them to variables and divide one from the other
let evenNum1 = 7;
let evenNum2 = 28;
let solution = evenNum2 / evenNum1;
// Check it worked by logging to the console
console.log(solution);
// Create two odd numbers, assign them to variables and multiply one from the other
let oddNum1 = -8;
let oddNum2 = -10;
let answer = oddNum1 * oddNum2;
// Check it worked by logging to the console
console.log(answer);
// Create a variable and log it's remainder, if divided by 3, to the console
let int = 10;
console.log(int % 3);

// Answer in plain text, what is modulo especially useful for?
// To get the remainder of a number that does not divide evenly
