// 10. Name two words that the terminal recognizes as numbers

// BONUS: Create a variable for each of the data types
let num = 1;
let myString = "Hello World";
let myBool = true;
let nothing = null;
let initVar = undefined;
let largeNum = 123n;
let sym = Symbol();
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
function myFunc() {}
let car = {
